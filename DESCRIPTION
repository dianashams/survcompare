Description: Performs repeated nested cross-validation for Cox Proportionate Hazards, Cox Lasso, Survival Random Forest, and their ensemble. Returns internally validated concordance index, time-dependent area under the curve, Brier score, calibration slope, and statistical testing of non-linear ensemble outperforming the baseline Cox model. In this, it helps researchers to quantify the gain of using a more complex survival model, or justify its redundancy. Equally, it shows the performance value of the non-linear and interaction terms, and may highlight the need of further feature transformation.
