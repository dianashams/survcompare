Description:  The package performs repeated nested cross-validation for a given survival data for Cox PH, Cox Lasso, Survival Random Forest (SRF), and ensemble of Cox and SRF. The outcome includes internally validated concordance index, time-dependent AUC, Brier score and calibration slope, and statistical testing results for the over-performance of SRF over the Cox PH and Cox Lasso. The package will help researchers analysing time-to-event data to quantify the gain of opting to a more complex model, or justify their redundancy. Equally, it will show the performance value of the non-linear and interaction terms, and may highlight the need of further feature transformation.
