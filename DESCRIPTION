Description: Repeated nested cross-validation for Cox Proportionate Hazards, Cox Lasso, Survival Random Forest models, and their ensemble. The outcome includes internally validated concordance index, time-dependent area under the curve, Brier score and calibration slopes, and the results of statistical testing of non-linear ensemble outperforming the baseline Cox model. The package helps researchers to quantify the gain of using a more complex survival model, or justify its redundancy. Equally, it will show the performance value of the non-linear and interaction terms, and may highlight the need of further feature transformation.
